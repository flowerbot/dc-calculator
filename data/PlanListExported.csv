It is understood that the infrastructure provided for in CP18 does not meet the definition of ""key community infrastructure"" in clause 31A of the amendment of Environmental Planning Regulation 2000 contained in Schedule 3 of the unproclaimed 2008 Amendment Act. If this Act is proclaimed, Council would make an application under proposed s 130 for the plan to be remade by the Minister. In this regard the infrastructure works already provided in accordance with this plan are the subject of an outstanding loan of $4.622M.

The business plans for CP 13 Cemeteries and CP18 Council Admin Offices and Technical Facilities are not yet finalised but will be forwarded by 31 December 2009. In the meantime CP13 and CP18 have been amended for exhibition with admin reduced from 10% to 5%.
